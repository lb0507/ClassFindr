# Welcome to ClassFindr!

ClassFindr was designed to help students, faculty, and visitors navigate the Sam Houston State University campus.
It is a web-based application that uses GPS technology to find walking routes from the user's location to a specified building.
Users that create an account can input and save their schedule for easy access to frequently used routes.

ClassFindr was developed for a group project in a software engineering course.

Since it was only a class project, the web app is no longer running, but feel free to take a look through the code!
